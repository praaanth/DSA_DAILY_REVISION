/*
find the shortest cycle in undirected graph
the idea is to apply the bfs similar to dikshtras 
  if we visit the back edge ans=min(ans,dis[it]+dis[node]+1)
   distance till ith node  dis till back edge node +1 connecting these two
   how we can check that already visited node is not a parent node
   if(dis[it]>=dis[node]) {
       this signifies that this is not a parent because parent will always have less distance
   }

   23 merge k sorted lists 
     there are three approaches 
        1 merging two-sorted list function applying to the 
           all the lists
            tc--> n*totalnumberofnodes
        2 using the priority queue
            tc--> nklog(k) space--> o(k)  because the priority queue will have at most k lists in it
              space is not n*k because we are storing only reference of the head pointer not the entire list

        3  applying the mergesort to avoid the space 
             the proof of deriving the merge sort is similar to deriving the tc for this problem see the note book for the for proof
