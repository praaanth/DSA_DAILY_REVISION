/*
find the shortest cycle in undirected graph
the idea is to apply the bfs similar to dikshtras 
  if we visit the back edge ans=min(ans,dis[it]+dis[node]+1)
   distance till ith node  dis till back edge node +1 connecting these two
   how we can check that already visited node is not a parent node
   if(dis[it]>=dis[node]) {
       this signifies that this is not a parent because parent will always have less distance
   }
